## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]

Voice-based user interfaces have a universal appeal. And why wouldn't they? Being able to talk to an application feels so much more natural than pressing buttons. Creating such interfaces using the Android SDK doesn't take much effort. In fact, you can create a simple app that behaves like a very limited clone of  Siri, Cortana, or Google Now in a matter of minutes. In this coffee break course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Ashraff Hathibelagal will be showing you how. By the end of the course, you'll know the basics of using Android's speech recognizer and text to speech APIs.
